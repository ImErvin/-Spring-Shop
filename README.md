# Spring-Shop
An online shop developed in Spring Boot and MySQL

This application was developed as part of my ServerSide RAD module in Software Development year 3.
<hr/>

The intention behind this application was to display our knowledge of MVC by creating a spring application to rapidly prototype a very
simple online shop with a MySQL database. This application is served with Apache Tomcat 9 using the J2EE platform.
